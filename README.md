# Exploring the Benefits of Transfer Learning While Building Brain Tumour Classifiers
### A comparative analysis of DL techniques

AI is huge. There are a lot of different models, parameters, and even subparameters to choose from. For image classification tasks, CNN-based models from scratch, and with transfer learning are currently the two most popular selections.

Transfer learning is a popular ML technique that applies previously learnt data onto a new dataset. Both models from scratch and transfer learning models can be used in image classification, and today we have applied these models in brain tumour classification tasks. When comparing these two models, transfer learning typically returns higher accuracies as transfer learning starts off with better initial results meaning they can be trained for less. Transfer learning models also achieve faster convergence as they already understand many features, and generalize well through the vast amount of data they have been previously trained on.
